# Platform Science Code Exercise

## Getting Started

### Running locally with Node already installed

1. After you have cloned the repo, open a console in the root directory of the project and type `npm install` - this will install your dependencies.
2. With a terminal open in the root of the project you can run it via `npm start -- <name of shipments file> <name of drivers file>`.

If you are using the files already provided, you can just copy the following `npm start -- shipments.txt drivers.txt` into the terminal.
You can start a debugging session using the following `npm run debug -- shipments.txt drivers.txt`.

### Some things to note

-   The name of the files to pass in the command line argument should be the name (with extension) of a file located in the `<project root>/data` directory.
-   I tried to keep the code simple with few dependencies
    -   [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) - Typescript runtime for Node so I can use TypeScript and not have to compile or anything
    -   [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) - So I can colorize the output - makes it a bit easier to see data in console
-   I did use JSDocs with a lot of the function definitions so you can see them pop up in intellisense - however, this documation is probably a little more than I would normally do since I try to keep express more with syntax than words.
-   I didn't include tests or hooks; however, I did use prettier - so if you see syntax like missing semicolons, it can change.

## Challenge

Our sales team has just struck a deal with Acme Inc to become the exclusive provider for routing their product shipments via 3rd party trucking fleets. The catch is that we can only route one shipment to one driver per day.

Each day we get the list of shipment destinations that are available for us to offer to drivers in our network. Fortunately our team of highly trained data scientists have developed a mathematical model for determining which drivers are best suited to deliver each shipment.

With that hard work done, now all we have to do is implement a program that assigns each shipment destination to a given driver while maximizing the total suitability of all shipments to all drivers.

The top-secret algorithm is:

??? If the length of the shipment's destination street name is even, the base suitability score (SS) is the number of vowels in the driver???s name multiplied by 1.5.  
??? If the length of the shipment's destination street name is odd, the base SS is the number of consonants in the driver???s name multiplied by 1.  
??? If the length of the shipment's destination street name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the length of the driver???s name, the SS is increased by 50% above the base SS.

Write an application in the language of your choice that assigns shipment destinations to drivers in a way that maximizes the total SS over the set of drivers. Each driver can only have one shipment and each shipment can only be offered to one driver. Your program should run on the command line and take as input two newline separated files, the first containing the street addresses of the shipment destinations and the second containing the names of the drivers. The output should be the total SS and a matching between shipment destinations and drivers. You do not need to worry about malformed input, but you should certainly handle both upper and lower case names.

### Deliverable

Your app:
??? May make use of any existing open source libraries

Send us:
??? The full source code, including any code written which is not part of the normal program run (e.g. build scripts)
??? Clear instructions on how to build/run the app

### Requirements

Application:

-   [ ] Each driver can only have one shipment
-   [ ] Each shipment can only be offerred to one driver
-   [ ] Should run on the command line and take as input two newline separated files, the first containing the street addresses of the shipment destinations and the second containing the names of the drivers
-   [ ] The output should be the total SS and a matching between shipment destinations and drivers
-   [ ] You do not need to worry about malformed input, but you should certainly handle both upper and lower case names.

Algorithm:

-   [ ] If the length of the shipment's destination street name is even, the base suitability score (SS) is the number of vowels in the driver???s name multiplied by 1.5.
-   [ ] If the length of the shipment's destination street name is odd, the base SS is the number of consonants in the driver???s name multiplied by 1.
-   [ ] If the length of the shipment's destination street name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the length of the driver???s name, the SS is increased by 50% above the base SS.
